                    During my time as an intern at Samsung Austin Semiconductor, Renuka was always willing
                    to guide me as I learned the ropes. Whether we were discussing the technical stack,
                     the latest technologies, or my intern project, she helped me to grow as a Software Engineer.
                      She advised me during my intern project even though she wasn't my direct mentor,
                       and helped me understand important parts of the projects we worked on. She's
                        clearly very strong technically, and was on top of her projects and the rest of the stack.
                    I felt very at home having a conversation and sharing coffee with Renuka at the SAS cafeteria.

                  Any intern would be lucky to have a mentor on the level of Renuka. I had the pleasure of working
                   under Renuka at Samsung Austin Semiconductor (SAS) for 2 months, during which I learned how to
                    manage large-scale databases, develop models for factory processes, and how to better serve
                     the customer as a software engineer. Above all, I was more than impressed with Renuka's ability
                      to understand several complex systems and provide solutions for different problems and different
                       users - her work contributed significantly to the success and efficiency of the Facilities team at SAS.
                  Renuka is also an extremely patient yet thorough mentor, always willing
                   to provide input/assistance while allowing others to solve problems without micromanagement.
                    Her guidance and kindness was one of the reasons I could enjoy work everyday at SAS.
                     Any future team that requires an experienced and skilled Software Developer
                      should keep their eye out for Renuka.

                Renuka is very easy to work with, very knowledgeable, efficient and creative. When I hired her,
                 we did not have any other programmers in Facilities so she helped us set up standard languages, programs and processes.
                 I would relish the opportunity to work with her again, and anyone fortunate enough
                  to have Renuka on their team will be fortunate indeed!

            I was Renuka's manager at Xerox for 6 years. It is difficult to find a professional programmer
             like Renuka who is always is willing to go the extra mile to complete her tasks on schedule and also complete
              the tasks with the accuracy and attention to detail that Renuka pays to all her tasks. Renuka's work
               was always of the best quality and she was always looking to widen her technical expertise.
                Any team that she belongs to will immensely benefit from her technical skills and experience
                 in a wide array of subjects. She was always offering innovative solutions to seemingly complex problems. 
              Aside from the technical skills she brought to my team, she was also a great person to work with.
               She is responsible and reliable. While on my team, she always approached challenges with
                a great positive attitude. This in turn always motivated the rest of the team and increased the productivity.
