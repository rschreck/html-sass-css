      "reviewText": "Any intern would be lucky to have a mentor on the level of Renuka. I had the pleasure of working under Renuka at Samsung Austin Semiconductor (SAS) for 2 months, during which I learned how to manage large-scale databases, develop models for factory processes, and how to better serve the customer as a software engineer. Above all, I was more than impressed with Renuka's ability to understand several complex systems and provide solutions for different problems and different users - her work contributed significantly to the success and efficiency of the Facilities team at SAS. Renuka is also an extremely patient yet thorough mentor, always willing to provide input/assistance while allowing others to solve problems without micromanagement. Her guidance and kindness was one of the reasons I could enjoy work everyday at SAS. Any future team that requires an experienced and skilled Software Developer should keep their eye out for Renuka."

      "reviewText": "Renuka is very easy to work with, very knowledgeable, efficient and creative. When I hired her, we did not have any other programmers in Facilities so she helped us set up standard languages, programs and processes. I would relish the opportunity to work with her again, and anyone fortunate enough to have Renuka on their team will be fortunate indeed!"

      "reviewText": "I was Renuka's manager at Xerox for 6 years. It is difficult to find a professional programmer like Renuka who is always is willing to go the extra mile to complete her tasks on schedule and also complete the tasks with the accuracy and attention to detail that Renuka pays to all her tasks. Renuka's work was always of the best quality and she was always looking to widen her technical expertise. Any team that she belongs to will immensely benefit from her technical skills and experience in a wide array of subjects. She was always offering innovative solutions to seemingly complex problems. Aside from the technical skills she brought to my team, she was also a great person to work with. She is responsible and reliable. While on my team, she always approached challenges with a great positive attitude. This in turn always motivated the rest of the team and increased the productivity."

Her personal as well as professional skill are more than enough for any senior position."
